              Before Hyper I worked as IT support in several companies with
              different support roles, from being the in house support for 200+

              This has gained me a lot of work experience with people in all

            <h3>Create effective front end code.</h3>
            <h4 class="interpretation">
              To have dry, upgradable, manageable, accessible, modern and robust
              code.
            </h4>
            <p>
              I see this goal as a never ending way of thinking. As the industry
              changes all the time, tech come and go, this means that to create effective
              front end code you need to be active within the community and keep
              yourself updated.
            </p>
            <p>
              In more practical terms, I try to keep away from libraries, so I
              am not dependable on someone else’s code. I’ve used GitHub in all
               projects during this term, which in turn has allowed
              for code reviews and cooperation within the groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a new coder, the code I’ve created are not to
              these standards at the moment, I am learning and finding my way,
              esentially still in my experimenting phase. 
            </p><p>
              But I do feel that I
              am on the right road and mindset. In my smaller projects - like my personal
              website - the code is planned and well executed - if tested with
              Googles Lighthouse, I get <a href="emilioh.se_2020-06-09_20-00-42.html" target="_blank">top score</a>.

              Responsive web design and adaptation of graphics to web pages.
            </h3>
            <h4 class="interpretation">
              To create designs that are responsive to several devices and
              think about how to implement graphics.
            </h4>
            <p>
              Responsiveness and the implementation of graphics are essential
              for creating websites, it’s a core function that will be the
              difference between a user staying on the site or leaving, to never
              come back.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s something I’m always thinking about in the projects I have
              worked in, sometimes we designed for both mobile and desktop before coding - but unfortunately its not something
              we have had the luxury to code in the projects. With the limited
              time we have with each project, the focus has always been more on
              actual functions in the code rather than the responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is because if the site has no function, then there is no need
              for a user to visit the site and we also have control over which
              device we are gonna present it with - thus responsiveness has had
              a lower priority in the projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is always to have a light, responsive and fast website, I
              personally like minimalism and that way of thinking is
              incorporated in everything I do, even the bytes of the images. The
              way of thinking regarding this goal is to assess the functionality of the graphics and
              website - then choose the format or library that fits the needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve also started to look at alternative ways of hosting graphics,
              services like <a href="https://cloudinary.com/" target="_blank">Cloudinary</a> - that can adjust the images that are
              hosted depending on the device or user or the needs of the
              provider.

              Creating solutions for composite problems in digital

              customer’s business, user behaviour, technical possibilities and

              technical knowledge.
            </h4>
            <p>
              During this term I’ve worked two clients, Train Brain and GRP.
            </p>
            <p>
              The groups I worked in had different approaches two these two
              modules and how we took on the assignments.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the The Frist App with Train Brain as a customer, we did
              not focus on the client - our reasoning was that the assignment
              was so open and we where so new with React that we wanted to focus
              on our own learnings then focusing on the client wishes - thus we
              did not have much contact with the client.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the second assignment, Code and Collaborate, we did focus on
              the client and had several meetings with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              We had weekly presentations with updates, prototypes and questions
              to to the clients - together with the client we planned our weeks
              so we could deliver something useful for the client.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think working this way gave me a great insight on how to
              communicate with the customer and adapt to their requirements
              without sacrificing my own knowledge or expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Going forward I will use what I have learned and start to create
              guidelines on how to work with customers.

            <p>
              To develop itself is essentially in my view a constant challenge
              that needs to be fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main solution is to learn how to search and where to search,
              then I also think it’s very helpful to discuss the information and
              different ways one can take to solve a design or code issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think all my projects reflect that I have solved complex
              challenges, both regarding design and function.

              developments.
            </h3>
            <p>
              I think my projects reflect completion of this course goal, the
              two main projects I have worked with this term are live and
              published - not fully completed, but they are presentable
              prototypes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my perspective coding is a constant loop of programming,
              debugging and test publishing, to keep the code from rot - this is
              a loop that can’t avoided and must be an ongoing process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The latter of the course goal can also be seen in my projects,
              during this term I’ve tested to build with React, Next and Gatsby.
            </p>
            <p>
              My two main projects are in React and my personal website is in
              Next, we have also used Node and a library called Masonry in the
              projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve also tested A-Frame to build a 3D scene in Javascript and
              others smaller libraries. I started to test Python as well so my
              experience in other languages are growing.

            <p>
              In the Cross Program Challenge I worked with people from other
              classes and I had to be even more adaptable than before, in the

              groups, and for the Code and Collaborate project I was the group
              leader as well as organiser.

              I planned goals for each week and schedule each day - in a day by
              day progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              This allowed my group to focus on tasks at hand instead of
              worrying or stressing about not knowing what the next step is,
              while keeping us agile and able to adapt to the weekly meeting of
              our client.

              Please take a look in our Notion for a deeper view of how we
              organised the group.
