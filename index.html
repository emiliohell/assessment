            Responsive web design and adaptation of graphics to web pages.
          </h3>
          <h4 class="interpretation">
            To create designs that are responsive to several devices and think
            about how to implement graphics.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Responsiveness and the implementation of graphics are essential for
            creating websites, it’s a core function that will be the difference
            between a user staying on the site or leaving, to never come back.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s something I’m always thinking about in the projects I have
            worked in, sometimes we designed for both mobile and desktop before
            coding - but unfortunately its not something we have had the luxury
            to code in the projects. With the limited time we have with each
            project, the focus has always been more on actual functions in the
            code rather than the responsiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is because if the site has no function, then there is no need
            for a user to visit the site and we also have control over which
            device we are gonna present it with - thus responsiveness has had a
            lower priority in the projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is always to have a light, responsive and fast website, I
            personally like minimalism and that way of thinking is incorporated
            in everything I do, even the bytes of the images. The way of
            thinking regarding this goal is to assess the functionality of the
            graphics and website - then choose the format or library that fits
            the needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve also started to look at alternative ways of hosting graphics,
            services like
            <a href="https://cloudinary.com/" target="_blank">Cloudinary</a> -
            that can adjust the images that are hosted depending on the device
            or user or the needs of the provider.
