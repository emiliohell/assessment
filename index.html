            This has gained me a lot of work experience with people in all ages

          </h3>
          <p>
            I see this goal as a never ending way of thinking. As the industry
            changes all the time, tech come and go, this means that to create
            effective front end code you need to be active within the community
            and keep yourself updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            In more practical terms, I try to keep away from libraries, so I am
            not dependable on someone else‚Äôs code. I‚Äôve used
            <a href="https://github.com/"
              ><em><strong>GitHub</strong></em></a
            >
            in all projects during this term, which in turn has allowed for code
            reviews and cooperation within the groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a new coder, the code I‚Äôve created are not to these standards at
            the moment, I am learning and finding my way, essentially still in
            my experimenting phase.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I do feel that I am on the right road and mindset. In my smaller
            projects - like my personal website - the code is planned and well
            executed - if tested with
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/"

          </h3>
          <p>
            Responsiveness and the implementation of graphics are essential for
            creating websites, it‚Äôs a core function that will be the difference
            between a user staying on the site or leaving, to never come back.
          </p>
          <p>
            It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm always thinking about in the projects I have
            worked on, sometimes we designed for both mobile and desktop before
            coding - but unfortunately its not something we have had the luxury
            to code in the projects. With the limited time we have with each
            project, the focus has always been more on actual functions in the
            code rather than the responsiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is because if the site has no function, then there is no need
            for a user to visit the site and as we have control over which
            device we are going to present it with - the responsiveness has had
            a lower priority in the projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            But my goal is always to have a light, responsive and fast website,
            I personally like minimalism and that way of thinking is
            incorporated in everything I do, even the bytes of the images. A
            rule to follow is to assess the functionality of the graphics and
            the website - then choose the format or library that fits the needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve also started to look at alternative ways of hosting graphics,
            services like
            <strong
              ><em><a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a></em></strong
            ><strong><em> </em></strong>- that can adjust the images that are
            hosted depending on the device or user or the needs of the provider
            - keeping the site faster and more responsive when it comes to
            images.

            During this term I‚Äôve worked two clients,

                ><a href="http://www.thetrainbrain.com/">Train Brain</a></em

            and

                ><a href="http://www.globalresiliencepartnership.org/"

                ></strong
              ></em
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <em><strong>The First App</strong></em> with
            <a href="http://www.thetrainbrain.com/"
              ><em><strong>Train Brain</strong></em></a
            >
            as a customer, we did not focus on the client - our reasoning was
            that the assignment was so open and we where so new with React, that
            we wanted to focus on our own learnings instead of focusing on the
            client wishes - thus we did not have much contact with the client
            during this assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the second assignment,
            <strong><em>Code and Collaborate</em></strong> with
            <a href="http://www.globalresiliencepartnership.org/"
              ><em><strong>GRP</strong></em></a
            >, we did focus on the client and had several meetings with them. We
            had weekly presentations with updates, prototypes and questions for
            the client - then together with the client we planned our weeks so
            we could deliver something useful for the client.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think working this way gave me a great insight on how to
            communicate with the customer and adapt to their requirements
            without sacrificing my own knowledge or expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going forward I will use what I have learned during
            <strong><em>Code and Collaborate </em></strong>and work in a smiliar
            way with future customers.

          <p>
            I think my projects reflect completion of this course goal, the two
            main projects I have worked with this term are live and published -
            not fully completed, but they are presentable prototypes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my perspective coding is a constant loop of programming,
            debugging and test publishing - and to keep the code from rot, this
            is a loop that can‚Äôt avoided and must be an ongoing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The latter of the course goal can also be seen in my projects,
            during this term I‚Äôve tested to build with
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/"
              ><em><strong>React</strong></em></a

            and
            <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/"
              ><em><strong>Gatsby</strong></em></a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            My two main projects are in
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/"
              ><em><strong>React</strong></em></a

            <em
              ><strong><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next</a></strong></em
            >, we have also used

              ><em><strong>Node</strong></em></a

            and a library called Masonry in the projects.

            to build a 3D scene in <strong>Javascript</strong> and others
            smaller libraries. I started to test <strong>Python</strong> as well
            so my experience in other languages are growing.

            The best example of me having experience with people working in
            different disciplines is the

          <p>
            In the <strong><em>Cross Program Challenge</em></strong> I worked
            with people from other classes and I had to be even more adaptable
            than before, in the projects with my class we have never had real
            defined roles - we have always worked on everything together as much
            as possible.
