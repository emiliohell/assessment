            Before Hyper I worked as IT support in several companies with
            different support roles, from being the in house support for 200+
            lawyers, to configure networks for wireless speaker systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            This has gained me a lot of work experience with people in all ages
            and nationalities - as the world is run on tech and everyone needs
            help.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now I am moving towards a more creative side of the tech industry.

            I see this goal as a never ending way of thinking. As the industry
            changes all the time, tech come and go, this means that to create
            effective front end code you need to be active within the community
            and keep yourself updated.

            In more practical terms, I try to keep away from libraries, so I am
            not dependable on someone else‚Äôs code. I‚Äôve used
            <a href="https://github.com/"
              ><em><strong>GitHub</strong></em></a
            >
            in all projects during this term, which in turn has allowed for code
            reviews and cooperation within the groups.

            As a new coder, the code I‚Äôve created are not to these standards at
            the moment, I am learning and finding my way, essentially still in
            my experimenting phase.

          </h3>
          <p>
            Responsiveness and the implementation of graphics are essential for
            creating websites, it‚Äôs a core function that will be the difference
            between a user staying on the site or leaving, to never come back.
          </p>
          <p>
            It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm always thinking about in the projects I have
            worked on, sometimes we designed for both mobile and desktop before
            coding - but unfortunately its not something we have had the luxury
            to code in the projects. With the limited time we have with each
            project, the focus has always been more on actual functions in the
            code rather than the responsiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is because if the site has no function, then there is no need
            for a user to visit the site and as we have control over which
            device we are going to present it with - the responsiveness has had
            a lower priority in the projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            But my goal is always to have a light, responsive and fast website,
            I personally like minimalism and that way of thinking is
            incorporated in everything I do, even the bytes of the images. A
            rule to follow is to assess the functionality of the graphics and
            the website - then choose the format or library that fits the needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôve also started to look at alternative ways of hosting graphics,
            services like
            <strong
              ><em><a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a></em></strong
            ><strong><em> </em></strong>- that can adjust the images that are
            hosted depending on the device or user or the needs of the provider
            - keeping the site faster and more responsive when it comes to
            images.
